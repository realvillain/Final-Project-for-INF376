# Final-Project-for-INF376
The project for the final exam of the course 'INF 376 Natural Language Processing'.
As the main dataset for the task of text classification was chosen: IMDB 50K Movie Reviews - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atulanandjha/imdb-50k-movie-reviews-test-your-bert

After preprocessing the data 4 models were implemented:  
1. TF-IDF + Random Forest
2. Keras Embedding + Conv1D
3. Word2Vec + LSTM
4. BERT + Dense

I compared the accuracy of all the models using the percentage of accuracy and
the indicators of the confusion matrix.
