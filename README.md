# Final-Project-for-INF376
The project for the final exam of the course 'INF 376 Natural Language Processing'.
As the main dataset for the task of text classification was chosen: IMDB 50K Movie Reviews - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atulanandjha/imdb-50k-movie-reviews-test-your-bert

The objective of this project is to implement text classification models and demonstrate their work using the example of film review sentiment classification. So, the task is to classify the feedback left by the user and determine the mood: negative or positive

After preprocessing the data 4 models were implemented:  
1. TF-IDF + Random Forest
2. Keras Embedding + Conv1D
3. Word2Vec + LSTM
# 4. BERT + Dense

I compared the accuracy of all the models using the percentage of accuracy and
the indicators of the confusion matrix. Here's the results:
